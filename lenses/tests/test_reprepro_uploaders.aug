(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     A star condition gets mapped as direct value
     of the "allow" node.
 *)

    "allow * by anybody\n" =

  { "allow" = "*"
          { "by" = "anybody" } }

(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     For simple keys, the "by" node gets the value "key"
     and the key ID gets mapped in a "key" subnode.
 *)
test Reprepro_Uploaders.entry get
    "allow * by key ABCD1234\n" =

  { "allow" = "*"
          { "by" = "key"
             { "key" = "ABCD1234" } } }

(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     Conditions are mapped inside a tree containing
     at least an "and" node and an "or" subnode.

     The value of each "or" subnode is the type of check
     (e.g. "source"), and this node contains "or" subnodes
     with the value(s) allowed for the check (e.g. "bash"). *)

(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     Check the field distribution *)

      { "or" = "distribution"
              { "or" = "sid" } } }
    { "by" = "anybody" } }

(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     Some checks use the "contain" keyword to loosen the condition.
     In that case, a "contain" subnode is added. Be sure to check for it
     to know how the condition has to be checked.

    Some checks support multiple values, separated by '|'.
    In this case, each value gets added to an "or" subnode.

(* Test: Reprepro_Uploaders.entry
     Negated conditions are mapped with a "not" subnode. *)
