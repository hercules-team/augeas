/* Reference counting for pointers to structs with a REF field of type ref_t
 *
 * When a pointer to such a struct is passed into a function that stores
 * it, the function can either "receive ownership", meaning it does not
 * increment the reference count, or it can "take ownership", meaning it
 * increments the reference count. In the first case, the reference is now
 * owned by wherever the function stored it, and not the caller anymore; in
 * the second case, the caller and whereever the reference was stored both
 * own the reference.
