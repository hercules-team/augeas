# Kernel Version string for the -kdump kernel, such as 2.6.13-1544.FC5kdump

# The kdump commandline is the command line that needs to be passed off to
# the kdump kernel.  This will likely match the contents of the grub kernel
# line.  For example:
#   KDUMP_COMMANDLINE="ro root=LABEL=/"
# If a command line is not specified, the default will be taken from
# /proc/cmdline
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE=""

# This variable lets us append arguments to the current kdump commandline
# As taken from either KDUMP_COMMANDLINE above, or from /proc/cmdline
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND="irqpoll maxcpus=1"

# Any additional kexec arguments required.  In most situations, this should
# be left empty
#
# Example:
#   KEXEC_ARGS="--elf32-core-headers"
KEXEC_ARGS=" --args-linux"

#Where to find the boot image
KDUMP_BOOTDIR="/boot"

#What is the image type used for kdump
KDUMP_IMG="vmlinuz"

#What is the images extension.  Relocatable kernels don't have one
