# specify additional command line arguments for atd
#
# -l Specifies  a  limiting  load  factor,  over which batch jobs should not be run, instead of the compile-time
#    choice of 0.8.  For an SMP system with n CPUs, you will probably want to set this higher than n-1.
# 
#  -b Specify the minimum interval in seconds between the start of two batch jobs (60 default).

#example: 
#OPTS="-l 4 -b 120"
