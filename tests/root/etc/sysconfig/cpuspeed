# /etc/sysconfig/cpuspeed
#
# This configuration file controls the behavior of both the
# cpuspeed daemon and various cpufreq modules.
# For the vast majority of users, there shouldn't be any need to
# alter the contents of this file at all. By and large, frequency
# scaling should Just Work(tm) with the defaults.

### DRIVER ###
# Your CPUFreq driver module
# Note that many drivers are now built-in, rather than built as modules,
# so its usually best not to specify one. The most commonly-needed driver
# module these days is 'p4-clockmod', however, in most cases, it is not
# recommended for use. See: http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/25/84
# default value: empty (try to auto-detect/use built-in)
DRIVER=

### GOVERNOR ###
# Which scaling governor to use
# Details on scaling governors for your cpu(s) can be found in
# cpu-freq/governors.txt, part of the kernel-doc package
# NOTES:
# - The GOVERNOR parameter is only valid on centrino, powernow-k8 (amd64)
#   and p4-clockmod platforms, other platforms that support frequency
#   scaling always use the 'userspace' governor.
# - Using the 'userspace' governor will trigger the cpuspeed daemon to run,
#   which provides said user-space frequency scaling.
# default value: empty (defaults to ondemand on centrino, powernow-k8,
#                       and p4-clockmod systems, userspace on others)
GOVERNOR=

### FREQUENCIES ###
# NOTE: valid max/min frequencies for your cpu(s) can be found in
# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
# on systems that support frequency scaling (though only after the
# appropriate drivers have been loaded via the cpuspeed initscript).
# maximum speed to scale up to
# default value: empty (use cpu reported maximum)
MAX_SPEED=
# minimum speed to scale down to
# default value: empty (use cpu reported minimum)
MIN_SPEED=

### SCALING THRESHOLDS ###
# Busy percentage threshold over which to scale up to max frequency
# default value: empty (use governor default)
UP_THRESHOLD=
# Busy percentage threshold under which to scale frequency down
# default value: empty (use governor default)
DOWN_THRESHOLD=

### NICE PROCESS HANDLING ###
# Let background (nice) processes speed up the cpu
# default value: 0 (background process usage can speed up cpu)
# alternate value: 1 (background processes will be ignored)
IGNORE_NICE=0
