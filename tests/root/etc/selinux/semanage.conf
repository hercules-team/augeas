# Specify how libsemanage will interact with a SELinux policy manager.
# The four options are:
#
#  "source"     - libsemanage manipulates a source SELinux policy
#  "direct"     - libsemanage will write directly to a module store.
#  /foo/bar     - Write by way of a policy management server, whose
#                 named socket is at /foo/bar.  The path must begin
#                 with a '/'.
#  foo.com:4242 - Establish a TCP connection to a remote policy
#                 management server at foo.com.  If there is a colon
#                 then the remainder is interpreted as a port number;
#                 otherwise default to port 4242.
module-store = direct

# When generating the final linked and expanded policy, by default
# semanage will set the policy version to POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as
# given in <sepol/policydb.h>.  Change this setting if a different
# version is necessary.
#policy-version = 19

# expand-check check neverallow rules when executing all semanage
# commands. There might be a penalty in execution time if this
# option is enabled.

# usepasswd check tells semanage to scan all pass word records for home directories
# and setup the labeling correctly. If this is turned off, SELinux will label only /home
# and home directories of users with SELinux login mappings defined, see
# semanage login -l for the list of such users.
# If you want to use a different home directory, you will need to use semanage fcontext command.
# For example, if you had home dirs in /althome directory you would have to execute
# semanage fcontext -a -e /home /althome
