    to an integer

    matching easier during development

## [release-0.7.3](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/tree/release-0.7.3) (2010-08-07)

  - aug_load: only reparse files that have actually changed; greatly speeds
    up reloading

    were defined with aug_defvar or aug_defnode; make sure
    /augeas/variables always exists
  - redefine all variables (by reevaluating their corresponding
    expressions) after a aug_load. This makes variables 'sticky' across
    loads
  - fix behavior of aug_defnode to not fail when the expression evaluates
    to a nonempty node set
  - make gnulib a git submodule so that we record the gnulib commit off
    which we are based
  - allow 'let rec' with non-recursive RHS

    defined by defnode points (BZ 613967)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/compare/release-0.7.1...release-0.7.2)

## [release-0.7.1](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/tree/release-0.7.1) (2010-04-21)

  - new primitive lens 'value' to set value of a node to a constant,
    similar to 'label' for the key (see http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html)
  - new builtins for printing and getting the types of a lens (see
    http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html)
  - add unit type to lens language; allow '_' as an identifier in let's to
    force evaluation for side effect only
  - Various fixes for Solaris. Augeas now builds cleanly on Solaris 5.10,
    and most of the tests pass. The three tests that fail all fail because
    the test scripts have Linux idiosyncrasies. This needs to be addressed
    in a future release. Much thanks to Dagobert Michelsen and the OpenCSW
    project (http://www.opencsw.org/) for providing me with access to their
    build farm.
  - fix crash when recursive lens was used in a nonrecursive lens (bug #100)
  - context free parser/recursive lenses: handle 'l?' properly (bug #119);
    distinguish between successful parse and parse with an error at end of
    input; do caller filtering to avoid spurious ambiguous parses with
    grammars containing epsilon productions
  - aug_get: return -1 when multiple nodes match (bug #121)
  - much better error message when iteration stops prematurely during
    put/create than the dreaded 'Short iteration'
  - augtool: ignore empty lines from stdin; report error when get fails
  - fix memory leak in file_info (transform.c); this was leaking a file
    name every time we loaded a file (Laine Stump)
  - nicer error message when typechecker spots ambiguity in atype
  - libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly
  - locale independence: handle a literal '|' properly on systems that lack
    use_locale
  - bootstrap: pull in isblank explicitly (needed on Solaris)
  - src/lens.c (lns_check_rec): fix refcounting mistake on error path (bug #120)
  - fix SEGV when loading empty files
  - improvements in handling some OOM's
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Approx: lens and test for the approx proxy server (Tim Stoop)
    * Cgconfig: lens and tests for libcgroup config (Ivana Hutarova Varekova)
    * Cgrules: new lens and test (Ivana Hutarova Varekova)
    * Cobblermodules: lens + tests for cobbler's modules.conf (Shannon Hughes)

    * Grub: support empty kernel parameters, Suse incl.s (Frederik Wagner)
    * Inittab: allow ':' in the process field (bug #109)
    * Logrotate: tolerate whitespace at the end of a line (bug #101); files
      can be separated by newlines (bug #104) (Raphael Pinson)
    * Modprobe: Suse includes (Frederik Wagner)
    * Nagisocfg: lens and test for /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg (Tim Stoop)
    * Ntp: add 'tinker' directive (bug #103)
    * Passwd: parse NIS entries on Solaris
    * Securetty: new lens and test for /etc/securetty (Simon Josi)
    * Shellvars: handle a bare 'export VAR'; Suse includes (Frederik
      Wagner); allow spaces after/before opening/closing parens for array
    * Sshd: allow optional arguments in subsystem commands (Matt Palmer)
    * Sudoers: allow del_negate even if no negate_node is found (bug #106)
               (Raphael Pinson); accept 'secure_path' (BZ 566134) (Stuart
               Sears)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/compare/release-0.7.0...release-0.7.1)

## [release-0.7.0](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/tree/release-0.7.0) (2010-01-15)

  - Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
    is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
    lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.
  - Support for case-insensitive regular expressions. Simply append 'i' to
    a regexp literal to make it case-insensitive, e.g. /hello/i will match
    all variations of hello, regardless of case.
  - Major revamp of augtool. In particular, path expressions don't need to
    be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.
  - Check during load/save that each file is only matched by one transform
    under /augeas/load. If there are multiple transforms for a file, the
    file is skipped.
  - New error codes AUG_ENOLENS and AUG_EMXFM
  - Do not choke on non-existing lens during save
  - Change the metadata for files under /augeas/files slightly: the node
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens now has the name of the lens used to load the

  - saving of backup (.augsave) files now works even if the original and
    backup files are on different devices
  - major refactoring of how path expressions are handled internally. Fixes

    /augeas/events/saved; aug_save also returns the number of files
    that were changed
  - preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
  - make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
    in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
  - report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
    is not allowed by the lens
  - quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
  - generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
    on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)

## [release-0.0.3](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/tree/release-0.0.3) (2008-02-26)

    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)
