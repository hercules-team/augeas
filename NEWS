0.3.6 - 2009-01-26
  - report version in /augeas/version, report legal save modes in
    /augeas/version/save/mode for feature tests/version checking
  - dynamically change behavior of aug_save; add noop save mode
    (Bryan Kearney)
  - plug memory leak, more portable SELinux test (Jim Meyering)
  - fix bz #478619 - do not use abspath (Arnaud Gomes-do-Vale)
  - fix segfault when branch in a union does not have a ktype
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Dpkg: new lens for Debian's dpkg.cfg (Robin Lee Powell)
    * Limits: new lens for /etc/security/limits.conf (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Soma: new lens for http://www.somasuite.org/ config
      (Free Ekanayaka)

      expand filter for Php config files (Robin Lee Powell)
    * Phpvars: whitspace fixes (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Puppet: accept indented puppet.conf (ticket #25)

0.3.5 - 2008-12-23
  - add an option to rewrite files by overwriting their contents instead of
    putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents
    are only copied after rename fails with EXDEV or EBUSY, and only if the
    node /augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails (fix #32)
  - saving of backup (.augsave) files now works even if the original and
    backup files are on different devices
  - major refactoring of how path expressions are handled internally. Fixes
    a number of bugs and oddities (e.g. tickets #7 and #23)
  - fix a bug in fa_as_regexp: a '.' wasn't escaped, ultimately leading to
    spurious errors from the typechecker
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Group: process /etc/group (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Passwd: process /etc/passwd (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Phpvars: process files that set PHP variables, in particular
      /etc/squirrelmail/config.php (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Rsyncd: process /etc/rsyncd.conf (Marc Fournier)
    * Shellvars: process /etc/arno-iptables-firewall/debconf.cfg and
      /etc/cron-apt/config (Free Ekanayaka), load /etc/sysconfig/sendmail
    * Postfix: process postfix's main.cf and master.cf (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Squid: new lens for squid.conf (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Webmin: new lens (Free Ekanayaka)

    * Sshd: change the structure of Condition subtrees (Dominique Dumont)

0.3.4 - 2008-11-05
  - fix saving of backup files; in 0.3.3, when AUG_SAVE_BACKUP was passed
    to aug_init, aug_save would always fail

0.3.3 - 2008-10-24
  - restore the behavior of aug_save; in 0.3.2, aug_save broke API by
    returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

0.3.2 - 2008-10-21
  - saving now reports which files were actually changed in
    /augeas/events/saved; aug_save also returns the number of files
    that were changed
  - preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
  - make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
    in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
  - report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
    is not allowed by the lens
  - quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
  - generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
    on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Grub: support the 'password' directive (Joel Nimety)
    * Grub: support 'serial' and 'terminal' directives (Sean E. Millichamp)
    * Samba: change default indentation and separators (Free Ekanayaka)

    * Sshd: Cleaner handling of 'Match' blocks (Dominique Dumont)
    * Monit: new lens (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Ldap: merge with Spacevars (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Shellvars: support /etc/default (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Shellvars: handle space at the end of a line

0.3.1 - 2008-09-04
  - Major performance improvement when processing huge files, reducing some
    O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
    manipulate for example /etc/hosts files with 65k lines
  - Handle character escapes '\x' in regular expressions in compliance with
    Posix ERE
  - aug_mv: fix bug when moving at the root level
  - Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
  - Typecheck del lens: for 'del RE STR', STR must match RE
  - Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
    '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
    produce tree nodes.
  - Many new/improved lenses
    * many lenses now map comments as '#comment' nodes instead of just
      deleting them
    * Sudoers: added (Raphael Pinson)
    * Hosts: map comments into tree, handle whitespace and comments
             at the end of a line (Kjetil Homme)

    * Php: map entries outside of sections to a '.anon' section
           (Raphael Pinson)

  - Fix segfault in store.put on NULL values
  - Properly move default lens dir with DATADIR (Jim Meyering)
  - Fix 'short iteration' error on get/parse of empty string; this bug

  - Report errors during get/put in the tree; added subnodes to
    /augeas/files/PATH/error for that purpose
  - Many many bugfixes:
    * plugged all known memory leaks
    * fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
    * reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
    * further performance improvements in libfa
    * check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving
  - libfa can now convert an automaton back to a regular expression
    (FA_AS_REGEXP)
  - New lenses
    * /etc/fstab
    * /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*

0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
  - Various changes to public API:
    * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
    * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
      struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
  - Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
  - Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
    concatenation and iteration
  - Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
    '-c' flag
  - Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
    quite a few stupid and subtle problems
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
  - Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
    backups
  - Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
  - Expose these two things as command line options in augtool

0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
  - Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
    structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
  - Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
    Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
  - package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
  - further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release.
  - Public API and basic tree data structure.
  - Record scanning works.
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
  - Simple tests and test driver
