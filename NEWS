      fa_state_* functions that make it possible to iterate over the FA's
      states and transitions. (Pedro Valero Mejia)
    * Add functions aug_ns_label, aug_ns_value, aug_ns_count, and
      aug_ns_path to get the label (with index), the value, the number of

1.9.0 - 2017-10-06

    * several improvements to the error messages when transforming a tree
      back to text fails. They now make it clearer what part of the tree
      was problematic, and what the tree should have looked like.
    * Fixed the pkg-config file, which should now be usable
    * Fix handling of backslash-escaping in strings and regular expressions
      in the lens language. We used to handle constructs like "\\" and
      /\\\\/ incorrectly. (Issue #495)
    * do not unescape the default value of a del on create; otherwise we are
      double unescaping these strings (Issue #507)
    * remove tempfile when saving files because destination is not writable
      (Issue #479)
    * span information is now updated on save (Issue #467)
    * fix lots of warnings generated by gcc 7.1
    * Various changes to reduce bashisms in tests and make them run on

1.8.1 - 2017-08-17
  - General changes/addition
    * Fix error in handling escaped whitespace at the end of path expressions
      (addresses CVE-2017-7555)

1.8.0 - 2017-03-20
  - General changes/additions
    * augtool: add a 'source' command exposing the aug_source API call
    * augtool: add a 'context' command to make changing into a node more
      discoverable
    * augtool: add an 'info' command to print important information
    * augtool: dramatically reduce memory consumption when all lenses are
      loaded by more aggressively releasing temporary data structures.  On
      my machine, maximum memory usage of 'augtool -L' drops from roughly
      90MB to about 20MB. This will not change the amount of memory used
      when only specific lenses are used, only the default behavior of
      loading all lenses, i.e., when -A is not passed.
    * make building augtool statically possible (Jörg Krause)
    * split aug_to_xml into its own source file, so that statically linking
      against libaugeas.a doesn't require also linking against libXml2 and
      its dependencies, provided aug_to_xml is not needed.
  - API changes
    * add aug_source to find the source file for a particular node
    * reduce memory consumption when AUG_NO_MODL_AUTOLOAD is _not_ passed;
      exact same details as described above for augtool
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Chrony: allow floating point numbers (Miroslav Lichvar)
              add new directives from chrony 3.0 and 3.1 (Miroslav Lichvar)
    * Krb5: support include/includedir directives (Jason Smith) (Issue #430)
            support realms that start with numbers (Dustin Wheeler) (Issue #437)
    * Multipath: update to multipath-0.4.9-99.el7 (Xavier Mol)
    * Php: also look for FPM files in /etc/php/*/fpm/pool.d (Daniel Dico)
    * Postfix_virtual: allow underscores in e-mail addresses (Jason Lingohr)
                       (Issue #439)
    * Radicale: new lens for config of http://radicale.org/ (James Valleroy)
    * Rsyslog: support multiple options in module statements (Craig Miskell)
    * Ssh: also look for files in in /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d (Ian Mortimer)
    * Tmpfiles: parse 'q'/'Q' modes, parse two-character arguments,
                parse three-digit file modes
    * Xml: support external entity declarations in the doctype (Issue #142)
    * Yum: also read DNF files from /etc/dnf (Pat Riehecky) (Issue #434)

1.7.0 - 2016-11-08
  - General changes/additions
    * allow multiple transforms handling the same file as long as they
      also use the same lens (reported by Rich Jones)
    * fix a use-after-free in recursive lenses when spans are
      enabled (Issue #397)
    * fix an illegal memory access during put that can be triggered by a
      lens of the form 'del ... | l1 . l2' when the put has to jump
      branches in the union (Issue #398)
    * a large number of fixes based on Coverity scanning and running with
      gcc's address sanitizer. None of the issues uncovered would have lead
      to particularly significant leaks (they were all on the order 100-200
      bytes) and often hard to trigger, but we now have proof that at least
      while running tests there are no leaks at all.
      See https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/pull/405 for details.
    * The type checker now checks regexes that are involved in
      expressions. For example, it used to be possible to write 'let rx =
      /a/ | /b)/' and not get an error from the syntax checker, even though
      'let rx = /b)/' would result in an error. Such constructs are now
      checked properly. This new check might lead to errors in existing
      lenses, requiring that they be fixed.

    * Cron_User: New lens to handle user crontab files in /var/spool/cron
    * Csv: fix failure to load lens on OpenBSD (Issue #396)

              keys for 6.x (Jason Antman)

1.6.0 - 2016-08-05
  - General changes/additions
    * augtool: add --load-file option, and corresponding load-file command
      to load individual files based on the autoload information in lenses
    * path expressions: numbers in path expressions are now 64 bit integers
      rather than whatever the C compiler decided 'int' would be
  - API changes
    * add aug_load_file to load individual files, bug #135
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Httpd: follow line continuations in comments
    * Nginx: look for nginx.conf in /usr/local/etc, too (Omer Katz)

    * Vsftpd: Add allow_writeable_chroot boolead option
           (Robert Moucha) (Issue #376)

      than dumping all help text
    * Path expressions: optimize performance of evaluating certain
      expressions
    * lots of safety improvements in libfa to avoid using uninitialized
      values and the like (Daniel Trebbien)
    * tolerate building against OSX' libedit (Issue #256)
  - API changes
    * aug_match: fix a bug where expressions like /foo/*[2] would match a
      hidden node and pretend there was no match at all. We now make sure
      we never match a hidden node. Thanks to Xavier Mol for reporting the
      problem.
    * aug_get: make sure we set *value to NULL, even if the provided path is
      invalid (Issue #372)
    * aug_rm: fix segfault when deleting a tree and one of its ancestors
      (Issue #319)

1.4.0 - 2015-05-22
  - General changes/additions
    * add a aug_escape_name call to sanitize strings for use in path
      expressions. There are a few characters that are special in path
      expressions. This function makes it possible to have them all escaped
      so that the resulting string can be used in a path expression and is
      guaranteed to only match a node with exactly that name
    * paths generated by Augeas are now properly escaped so that, e.g., the
      strings returned by aug_match can always be fed to aug_get, even if
      they contain special characters

      and then switching to interactive mode (Robert Drake)

    errors; bug #138
  - Avoid losing already parsed nodes under certain circumstances; bug #144
  - Properly record the new mtime of a saved file; previously the mtime in
    the tree was reset to 0 when a file was saved, causing unnecessary file

0.7.3 - 2010-08-06
  - aug_load: only reparse files that have actually changed; greatly speeds
    up reloading
  - record all variables in /augeas/variables, regardless of whether they
    were defined with aug_defvar or aug_defnode; make sure
    /augeas/variables always exists
  - redefine all variables (by reevaluating their corresponding
    expressions) after a aug_load. This makes variables 'sticky' across
    loads
  - fix behavior of aug_defnode to not fail when the expression evaluates
    to a nonempty node set
  - make gnulib a git submodule so that we record the gnulib commit off
    which we are based
  - allow 'let rec' with non-recursive RHS
  - fix memory corruption when reloading a tree into which a variable
    defined by defnode points (BZ 613967)

      space-separated words as lists (Frederik Wagner)

0.7.1 - 2010-04-21
  - new primitive lens 'value' to set value of a node to a constant,
    similar to 'label' for the key (see http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html)
  - new builtins for printing and getting the types of a lens (see
    http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html)
  - add unit type to lens language; allow '_' as an identifier in let's to
    force evaluation for side effect only
  - Various fixes for Solaris. Augeas now builds cleanly on Solaris 5.10,
    and most of the tests pass. The three tests that fail all fail because
    the test scripts have Linux idiosyncrasies. This needs to be addressed
    in a future release. Much thanks to Dagobert Michelsen and the OpenCSW
    project (http://www.opencsw.org/) for providing me with access to their
    build farm.
  - fix crash when recursive lens was used in a nonrecursive lens (bug #100)
  - context free parser/recursive lenses: handle 'l?' properly (bug #119);
    distinguish between successful parse and parse with an error at end of
    input; do caller filtering to avoid spurious ambiguous parses with
    grammars containing epsilon productions
  - aug_get: return -1 when multiple nodes match (bug #121)
  - much better error message when iteration stops prematurely during
    put/create than the dreaded 'Short iteration'
  - augtool: ignore empty lines from stdin; report error when get fails
  - fix memory leak in file_info (transform.c); this was leaking a file
    name every time we loaded a file (Laine Stump)
  - nicer error message when typechecker spots ambiguity in atype
  - libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly
  - locale independence: handle a literal '|' properly on systems that lack
    use_locale
  - bootstrap: pull in isblank explicitly (needed on Solaris)
  - src/lens.c (lns_check_rec): fix refcounting mistake on error path (bug #120)

    * Inittab: allow ':' in the process field (bug #109)
    * Logrotate: tolerate whitespace at the end of a line (bug #101); files
      can be separated by newlines (bug #104) (Raphael Pinson)
    * Modprobe: Suse includes (Frederik Wagner)
    * Nagisocfg: lens and test for /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg (Tim Stoop)

      Wagner); allow spaces after/before opening/closing parens for array
    * Sshd: allow optional arguments in subsystem commands (Matt Palmer)
    * Sudoers: allow del_negate even if no negate_node is found (bug #106)
               (Raphael Pinson); accept 'secure_path' (BZ 566134) (Stuart
               Sears)

0.7.0 - 2010-01-14
  - Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
    is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
    lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.
  - Support for case-insensitive regular expressions. Simply append 'i' to
    a regexp literal to make it case-insensitive, e.g. /hello/i will match
    all variations of hello, regardless of case.
  - Major revamp of augtool. In particular, path expressions don't need to
    be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.
  - Check during load/save that each file is only matched by one transform
    under /augeas/load. If there are multiple transforms for a file, the
    file is skipped.
  - New error codes AUG_ENOLENS and AUG_EMXFM
  - Do not choke on non-existing lens during save
  - Change the metadata for files under /augeas/files slightly: the node
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens now has the name of the lens used to load the
    file; the source location of that lens has moved to
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens/info
  - New public functions fa_nocase, fa_is_nocase, and fa_expand_nocase in
    libfa
  - Various smaller bug fixes, performance improvements and improved error

    error details in a variety of places
  - Path expressions: add regexp matching; add operator '|' to form union
    of nodesets (ticket #89)

    transforms marked with autoload are reported under /augeas/load
  - New flag AUG_NO_LOAD for aug_init to keep it from loading files on
    startup; add --noload option to augtool
  - New API calls aug_defvar and aug_defnode to define variables for
    path expressions; exposed as 'defvar' and 'defnode' in augtool
  - Lenses distributed with Augeas are now installed in
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist, which is searched after
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses, so that lenses installed by other packages
    take precedence
  - New program examples/fadot to draw various finite automata (Francis
    Giraldeau)
  - Report line number and character offset in the tree when parsing a

0.3.5 - 2008-12-23
  - add an option to rewrite files by overwriting their contents instead of
    putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents

  - fix saving of backup files; in 0.3.3, when AUG_SAVE_BACKUP was passed
    to aug_init, aug_save would always fail

0.3.3 - 2008-10-24
  - restore the behavior of aug_save; in 0.3.2, aug_save broke API by
    returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

0.3.2 - 2008-10-21
  - saving now reports which files were actually changed in
    /augeas/events/saved; aug_save also returns the number of files
    that were changed
  - preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
  - make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
    in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
  - report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
    is not allowed by the lens
  - quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
  - generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
    on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)

0.3.1 - 2008-09-04
  - Major performance improvement when processing huge files, reducing some
    O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
    manipulate for example /etc/hosts files with 65k lines
  - Handle character escapes '\x' in regular expressions in compliance with
    Posix ERE
  - aug_mv: fix bug when moving at the root level
  - Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
  - Typecheck del lens: for 'del RE STR', STR must match RE
  - Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
    '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
    produce tree nodes.
  - Many new/improved lenses
    * many lenses now map comments as '#comment' nodes instead of just
      deleting them
    * Sudoers: added (Raphael Pinson)
    * Hosts: map comments into tree, handle whitespace and comments
             at the end of a line (Kjetil Homme)

0.2.2 - 2008-07-18
  - Fix segfault in store.put on NULL values
  - Properly move default lens dir with DATADIR (Jim Meyering)
  - Fix 'short iteration' error on get/parse of empty string; this bug
    made it impossible to save into a new file
  - Add 'insa' and 'insb' primitives to allow insertion from
    put unit tests
  - aug_insert: handle insertion before first child properly
  - New lenses
    * /etc/exports: NFS exports
    * /etc/dput.cf: Debian's dput (Raphael Pinson)
    * /etc/aliases: don't require whitespace after comma (Greg Swift)

0.2.1 - 2008-07-01
  - Address some compilation issues found on Ubuntu/Debian unstable
  - Fix segfault when aug_init/close are called multiple times
  - Man page for augparse
  - New lenses
    * /etc/sysconfig/selinux
    * Bugfixes for grub.conf

0.2.0 - 2008-06-05
  - Augeas is now much more portable
    * Pull in gnulib on non-glibc systems
    * Augeas now builds and runs on FreeBSD (possibly others, too)
  - Various fixes for memory corruption and the like
    (Jim Meyering, James Antill)
  - New lenses
    * vsftpd.conf
    * various bugfixes in existing lenses

0.1.1 - 2008-05-16
  - Add subtraction of regexps to the language, for example
      let re = /[a-z]+/ - /(Allow|Deny)Users/
  - Report errors during get/put in the tree; added subnodes to
    /augeas/files/PATH/error for that purpose
  - Many many bugfixes:
    * plugged all known memory leaks
    * fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
    * reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
    * further performance improvements in libfa
    * check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving
  - libfa can now convert an automaton back to a regular expression
    (FA_AS_REGEXP)
  - New lenses
    * /etc/fstab
    * /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*

0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
  - Various changes to public API:
    * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
    * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
      struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)
    * Const-correctness of public API, return error indication
      from aug_print (Jim Meyering)
    * Make buildable on Debian Etch (remove -fstack-protector from compiler
      switches)
  - Public API is now stable, and existing calls will be supported without
    further changes
  - New schema:
    * /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* (Alan Pevec)
    * Assorted other files from /etc/sysconfig (the ones that just set
      shell variables)
    * /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* (Dean Wilson)
  - Man page for augtool (Dean Wilson)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
  - Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
  - Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
    concatenation and iteration
  - Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
    '-c' flag
  - Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
    quite a few stupid and subtle problems
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
  - Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
    backups
  - Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
  - Expose these two things as command line options in augtool

0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
  - Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
    structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
  - Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
    Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
  - package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
  - further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release.
  - Public API and basic tree data structure.
  - Record scanning works.
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
  - Simple tests and test driver
