0.10.0 - 2011-12-02
  - support relative paths by taking them relative to the value
    of /augeas/context in all API functions where paths are used
  - add aug_to_xml to API: transform tree(s) into XML, exposed as dump-xml
    in aug_srun and augtool. Introduces dependency on libxml2
  - fix regular expression escaping. Previously, /[\/]/ match either a
    backslash or a slash. Now it only matches a slash
  - path expressions: add function 'int' to convert a node value (string)
    to an integer
  - path expressions: make sure the regexp produced by empty nodesets from
    regexp() and glob() matches nothing, rather than the empty word
  - fix --autosave when running single command from command line, BZ 743023
  - aug_srun: support 'insert' and 'move' as aliases for 'ins' and 'mv'
  - aug_srun: allow escaping of spaces, quotes and brackets with \
  - aug_init: accept AUG_NO_ERR_CLOSE flag; return augeas handle even when
    intialization fails so that caller gets some details about why
    initialization failed
  - aug_srun: tolerate trailing white space in commands
  - much improved, expanded documentation of many lenses
  - always interpret lens filter paths as absolute, bug #238
  - fix bug in libfa that would incorrectly calculate the difference of a
    case sensistive and case insensitive regexp (/[a-zA-Z]+/ - /word/i
    would match 'worD')
  - new builtin 'regexp_match' for .aug files to make testing regexp
    matching easier during development
  - fix 'span' command, bug #220

0.7.3 - 2010-08-06
  - aug_load: only reparse files that have actually changed; greatly speeds
    up reloading
  - record all variables in /augeas/variables, regardless of whether they
    were defined with aug_defvar or aug_defnode; make sure
    /augeas/variables always exists
  - redefine all variables (by reevaluating their corresponding
    expressions) after a aug_load. This makes variables 'sticky' across
    loads

      space-separated words as lists (Frederik Wagner)

0.7.1 - 2010-04-21
  - new primitive lens 'value' to set value of a node to a constant,
    similar to 'label' for the key (see http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html)
  - new builtins for printing and getting the types of a lens (see
    http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html)
  - add unit type to lens language; allow '_' as an identifier in let's to
    force evaluation for side effect only
  - Various fixes for Solaris. Augeas now builds cleanly on Solaris 5.10,
    and most of the tests pass. The three tests that fail all fail because
    the test scripts have Linux idiosyncrasies. This needs to be addressed
    in a future release. Much thanks to Dagobert Michelsen and the OpenCSW
    project (http://www.opencsw.org/) for providing me with access to their
    build farm.
  - fix crash when recursive lens was used in a nonrecursive lens (bug #100)
  - context free parser/recursive lenses: handle 'l?' properly (bug #119);
    distinguish between successful parse and parse with an error at end of
    input; do caller filtering to avoid spurious ambiguous parses with
    grammars containing epsilon productions
  - aug_get: return -1 when multiple nodes match (bug #121)
  - much better error message when iteration stops prematurely during
    put/create than the dreaded 'Short iteration'
  - augtool: ignore empty lines from stdin; report error when get fails
  - fix memory leak in file_info (transform.c); this was leaking a file
    name every time we loaded a file (Laine Stump)
  - nicer error message when typechecker spots ambiguity in atype
  - libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly
  - locale independence: handle a literal '|' properly on systems that lack
    use_locale
  - bootstrap: pull in isblank explicitly (needed on Solaris)
  - src/lens.c (lns_check_rec): fix refcounting mistake on error path (bug #120)

    * Sudoers: allow del_negate even if no negate_node is found (bug #106)
               (Raphael Pinson); accept 'secure_path' (BZ 566134) (Stuart
               Sears)

0.7.0 - 2010-01-14
  - Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
    is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
    lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.
  - Support for case-insensitive regular expressions. Simply append 'i' to
    a regexp literal to make it case-insensitive, e.g. /hello/i will match
    all variations of hello, regardless of case.
  - Major revamp of augtool. In particular, path expressions don't need to
    be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.
  - Check during load/save that each file is only matched by one transform
    under /augeas/load. If there are multiple transforms for a file, the
    file is skipped.
  - New error codes AUG_ENOLENS and AUG_EMXFM
  - Do not choke on non-existing lens during save
  - Change the metadata for files under /augeas/files slightly: the node
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens now has the name of the lens used to load the
    file; the source location of that lens has moved to
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens/info
  - New public functions fa_nocase, fa_is_nocase, and fa_expand_nocase in
    libfa
  - Various smaller bug fixes, performance improvements and improved error

0.5.0 - 2009-03-27
  - Clean up interface for libfa; the interface is now considered stable
  - New aug_load API call; allows controlling which files to load by
    modifying /augeas/load and then calling aug_load; on startup, the
    transforms marked with autoload are reported under /augeas/load
  - New flag AUG_NO_LOAD for aug_init to keep it from loading files on
    startup; add --noload option to augtool
  - New API calls aug_defvar and aug_defnode to define variables for
    path expressions; exposed as 'defvar' and 'defnode' in augtool
  - Lenses distributed with Augeas are now installed in
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist, which is searched after
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses, so that lenses installed by other packages
    take precedence
  - New program examples/fadot to draw various finite automata (Francis
    Giraldeau)
  - Report line number and character offset in the tree when parsing a
    file with a lens fails
  - Fix error in propagation of dirty flag, which could lead to only
    parts of a tree being saved when multiple files were modified
  - Flush files to disk before moving them
  - Fix a number of memory corruptions in the XPath evaluator
  - Several performance improvements in libfa
  - Lens changes/additions

  - Bug fixes in path expressions
    * for numbers, the meaning of '<' and '<=' was reversed
  - Always create an entry /files in aug_init
  - New builtin 'Sys' module with functions 'getenv' and 'read_file',
    the latter reads a the contents of a file into a string

    * Postfix_main: handle continuation lines
    * Bbhosts, Hosts, Logrotate, Sudoers: label comment nodes as '#comment'
    * Sshd: map comments as '#comment' nodes
    * Squid: add all keywords from squid 2.7 and 3 (Francois Deppierraz)

  - Various bug fixes and syntax enhancements for path expressions
    (see tests/xpath.tests for details)
  - Evaluate path expressions with multiple predicates correctly

0.3.5 - 2008-12-23
  - add an option to rewrite files by overwriting their contents instead of
    putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents
    are only copied after rename fails with EXDEV or EBUSY, and only if the
    node /augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails (fix #32)
  - saving of backup (.augsave) files now works even if the original and
    backup files are on different devices
  - major refactoring of how path expressions are handled internally. Fixes

    * Sshd: change the structure of Condition subtrees (Dominique Dumont)

0.3.4 - 2008-11-05
  - fix saving of backup files; in 0.3.3, when AUG_SAVE_BACKUP was passed
    to aug_init, aug_save would always fail

0.3.3 - 2008-10-24
  - restore the behavior of aug_save; in 0.3.2, aug_save broke API by
    returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

0.3.2 - 2008-10-21
  - saving now reports which files were actually changed in
    /augeas/events/saved; aug_save also returns the number of files
    that were changed
  - preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
  - make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
    in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
  - report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
    is not allowed by the lens
  - quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
  - generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
    on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)
  - Lens changes/additions

    * Ldap: merge with Spacevars (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Shellvars: support /etc/default (Free Ekanayaka)
    * Shellvars: handle space at the end of a line

0.3.1 - 2008-09-04
  - Major performance improvement when processing huge files, reducing some
    O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
    manipulate for example /etc/hosts files with 65k lines
  - Handle character escapes '\x' in regular expressions in compliance with
    Posix ERE
  - aug_mv: fix bug when moving at the root level
  - Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
  - Typecheck del lens: for 'del RE STR', STR must match RE
  - Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
    '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
    produce tree nodes.
  - Many new/improved lenses
    * many lenses now map comments as '#comment' nodes instead of just
      deleting them
    * Sudoers: added (Raphael Pinson)
    * Hosts: map comments into tree, handle whitespace and comments
             at the end of a line (Kjetil Homme)

    * fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
    * reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
    * further performance improvements in libfa
    * check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving
  - libfa can now convert an automaton back to a regular expression
    (FA_AS_REGEXP)
  - New lenses
    * /etc/fstab
    * /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*

0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
  - Various changes to public API:
    * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
    * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
      struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
  - Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
  - Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
    concatenation and iteration
  - Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
    '-c' flag
  - Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
    quite a few stupid and subtle problems
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
  - Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
    backups

    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release.
  - Public API and basic tree data structure.
  - Record scanning works.
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
