0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
  - Various changes to public API:
    * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
    * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
      struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)
    * Const-correctness of public API, return error indication
      from aug_print (Jim Meyering)
    * Make buildable on Debian Etch (remove -fstack-protector from compiler
      switches)
  - Public API is now stable, and existing calls will be supported without
    further changes
  - New schema:
    * /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* (Alan Pevec)
    * Assorted other files from /etc/sysconfig (the ones that just set
      shell variables)
    * /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* (Dean Wilson)
  - Man page for augtool (Dean Wilson)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
  - Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
  - Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
    concatenation and iteration
  - Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
    '-c' flag
  - Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
    quite a few stupid and subtle problems
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
  - Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
    backups
  - Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
  - Expose these two things as command line options in augtool

0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
  - Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
    structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
  - Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
    Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
  - package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
  - further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release.
  - Public API and basic tree data structure.
  - Record scanning works.
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
  - Simple tests and test driver
