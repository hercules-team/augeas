This file explains some details about developing the Augeas C library.

Check out the sources
---------------------

The sources are in a git repo (which you presumably found already)

  git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/augeas.git

Building from git
-----------------

  Besides the usual build tools (gcc, autoconf, automake etc.) you need the
  following tools and libraries to build Augeas:

    * Bison
    * Flex
    * readline-devel
    * libselinux-devel (optional)

  Augeas uses gnulib, and you need a checkout of gnulib. The build scripts
  can create a checkout for you behind the scenes - though if you already
  have a gnulib checkout, you can pass its location to autogen.sh with the
  --gnulib-srcdir option.

  At its simplest, you build Augeas from git by running the following
  commands in the toplevel directory of your Augeas checkout:

    ./autogen.sh [--gnulib-srcdir=$GNULIB_CHECKOUT]
    make && make install

  It is recommended though to turn on a few development features when
  building; in particular, stricter compiler warnings and some debug
  logging. You can pass these options either to autogen.sh or to
  configure. You'd then run autogen like this:

    ./autogen.sh --enable-compile-warnings=error --enable-debug=yes

Running augtool
---------------

The script ./src/try can be used to run ./src/augtool against a fresh
filesystem root. It copies the files from tests/root/ to build/try/ and
starts augtool against that root, using the lenses from lenses/ (and none
of the ones that might be installed on your system)

The script can be used for the following; OPTS are options that are passed
to augtool verbatim

  ./src/try OPTS     - run the commands from /tmp/augcmds.txt
  ./src/try cli OPTS - start an interactive session with augtool
  ./src/try gdb      - start gdb and set it up for debugging augtool
  ./src/try valgrind - run the commands from /tmp/augcmds.txt through augtool
                       under valgrind to check for memory leaks
