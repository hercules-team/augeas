=head1 NAME

augtool - inspect and modify configuration files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

augtool [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files
in their native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration
changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back into
native config files.

augtool provides a command line interface to the generated tree. COMMAND
can be a single command as described under L</COMMANDS>. When called with
no COMMAND, it reads commands from standard input until an end-of-file is
encountered.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c>, B<--typecheck>

Typecheck lenses. This can be very slow, and is therefore not done by
default, but is highly recommended during development.

=item B<-b>, B<--backup>

When files are changed, preserve the originals in a file with extension
'.augsave'

=item B<-n>, B<--new>

Save changes in files with extension '.augnew', do not modify the original
files

=item B<-r>, B<--root>=I<ROOT>

Use directory ROOT as the root of the filesystem. Takes precedence over a
root set with the AUGEAS_ROOT environment variable.

=item B<-I>, B<--include>=I<DIR>

Add DIR to the module loadpath. Can be given multiple times. The
directories set here are searched before any directories specified in the
AUGEAS_LENS_LIB environment variable, and before the default directory
F</usr/share/augeas/lenses>.

=item B<-f>, B<--file>=I<FILE>

Read commands from FILE.

=item B<-i>, B<--interactive>

Read commands from the terminal. When combined with B<-f> or redirection of
stdin, drop into an interactive session after executing the commands from
the file.

=item B<-e>

When reading commands from a file via stdin, echo the commands before
printing their output.

=item B<-s>, B<--autosave>

Automatically save all changes at the end of the session.

=item B<-S>, B<--nostdinc>

Do not search any of the default directories for modules. When this option
is set, only directories specified explicitly with B<-I> or specified in
B<AUGEAS_LENS_LIB> will be searched for modules.

=item B<-L>, B<--noload>

Do not load any files on startup. This is generally used to fine-tune which
files to load by modifying the entries in C</augeas/load> and then issuing
a C<load> command.

=item B<-A>, B<--noautoload>

Do not load any lens modules, and therefore no files, on startup. This
creates no entries under C</augeas/load> whatsoever; to read any files,
they need to be set up manually and loading must be initiated with a
C<load> command. Using this option gives the fastest startup.

=item B<--version>

Print version information and exit. The version is also in the tree under
C</augeas/version>.

=back

=head1 COMMANDS

In interactive mode, commands and paths can be completed by pressing C<TAB>.

The paths accepted as arguments by commands use a small subset of XPath
path expressions. A path expression consists of a number of segments,
separated by C</>. In each segment, the character C<*> can be used to match
every node regardless of its label. Sibling nodes with identical labels can
be distinguished by appending C<[N]> to their label to match the N-th
sibling with such a label. The last sibling with a specific label can be
reached as C<[last()]>. See L</EXAMPLES> for some examples of this.

=over 4

=item B<quit>

Exit the program

=item B<ls> E<lt>PATHE<gt>

List the direct children of PATH

=item B<match> E<lt>PATTERNE<gt> [E<lt>VALUEE<gt>]

Find all paths that match PATTERN. If VALUE is given, only the matching
paths whose value equals VALUE are printed

=item B<rm> E<lt>PATHE<gt>

Delete PATH and all its children from the tree

=item B<mv> E<lt>SRCE<gt> E<lt>DSTE<gt>

Move node SRC to DST. SRC must match exactly one node in the tree.  DST
must either match exactly one node in the tree, or may not exist yet. If
DST exists already, it and all its descendants are deleted. If DST does not
exist yet, it and all its missing ancestors are created.

=item B<set> E<lt>PATHE<gt> E<lt>VALUEE<gt>

Associate VALUE with PATH. If PATH is not in the tree yet,
it and all its ancestors will be created.

=item B<clear> E<lt>PATHE<gt>

Set the value for PATH to NULL. If PATH is not in the tree yet, it and all
its ancestors will be created.

=item B<setm> E<lt>BASEE<gt> E<lt>SUBE<gt> E<lt>VALUEE<gt>

Set multiple nodes in one operation.  Find or create a node matching SUB by
interpreting SUB as a path expression relative to each node matching
BASE. If SUB is '.', the nodes matching BASE will be modified.

=item B<get> E<lt>PATHE<gt>

Print the value associated with PATH

=item B<print> I<[E<lt>PATHE<gt>]>

Print entries in the tree. If PATH is given, printing starts there,
otherwise the whole tree is printed

=item B<dump-xml> I<[E<lt>PATHE<gt>]> I<[E<lt>FILENAMEE<gt>]>

Print entries in the tree as XML. If PATH is given, printing starts there,
otherwise the whole tree is printed. If FILENAME is given, the XML is saved
to the given file.

=item B<ins> I<E<lt>LABELE<gt>> I<E<lt>WHEREE<gt>> I<E<lt>PATHE<gt>>

Insert a new node with label LABEL right before or after PATH into the
tree. WHERE must be either 'before' or 'after'.

=item B<save>

Save all pending changes to disk. Unless either the B<-b> or B<-n>
command line options are given, files are changed in place.

=item B<load>

Load files according to the transforms in C</augeas/load>.

=item B<defvar> E<lt>NAMEE<gt> E<lt>EXPRE<gt>

Define the variable NAME to the result of evaluating EXPR. The variable
can be used in path expressions as $NAME. Note that EXPR is evaluated when
the variable is defined, not when it is used.

=item B<defnode> E<lt>NAMEE<gt> E<lt>EXPRE<gt> [E<lt>VALUEE<gt>]

Define the variable NAME to the result of evaluating EXPR, which must be a
nodeset. If no node matching EXPR exists yet, one is created and NAME will
refer to it. If VALUE is given, this is the same as 'set EXPR VALUE'; if
VALUE is not given, the node is created as if with 'clear EXPR' would and
NAME refers to that node.

=item B<span> E<lt>PATHE<gt>

Print the name of the file from which the node PATH was generated, as well
as information about the positions in the file corresponding to the label,
the value, and the entire node. PATH must match exactly one node.

You need to run 'set /augeas/span enable' prior to loading files to enable
recording of span information. It is disabled by default.

=item B<help>

Print this help text

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item B<AUGEAS_ROOT>

The file system root, defaults to '/'. Can be overridden with
the B<-r> command line option

=item B<AUGEAS_LENS_LIB>

Colon separated list of directories with lenses. Directories specified here
are searched after any directories set with the B<-I> command line option,
but before the default directory F</usr/share/augeas/lenses>

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Normally, exit status is 0. If one or more commands fail, the exit status
is set to a non-zero value.

Note though that failure to load some of the files specified by transforms
in C</augeas/load> is not considered a failure. If it is important to know
that all files were loaded, you need to issue a C<match /augeas//error>
after loading to find out details about what files could not be loaded and
why.

=head1 EXAMPLES

  augtool print '/files/etc/ssh/sshd_config/AcceptEnv[2]/3'

  # Find the entry in inittab with action 'initdefault'
  augtool> match /files/etc/inittab/*/action initdefault

  # Print the last alias for each entry in /etc/hosts
